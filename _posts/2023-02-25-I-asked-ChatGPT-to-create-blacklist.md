I created a discord server for comp sci classes that I ‘m taking this semester last week. Now that people are joining and slowly populating our server and I just realized that I didn’t really thought of being mod or  anything when I created this server from out of board. But do not worry, I found this thing called “auto mod” in the server settings. It comes with pack of modding automation features and all of em look fancy to me. So I was turning them on one by one.
